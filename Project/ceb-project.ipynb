    "The idea of this assignment is to perform an exploratory data analysis of a given dataset, using Python and Pandas. You are expected to deliver a notebook where you  combine your explanations with the corresponding code and charts. You should report your intended goals and findings in a transparent way. The intended audience is your fellow students. They should be able to understand the code you write, together with the explanations that you give for this code."

In order to do so, before submitting you should copy your development notebook into a new file and clean it by deleting spurious tests and code.\n",
